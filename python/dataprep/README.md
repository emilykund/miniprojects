###Simple Data Cleaning Script###

###Executive Summary:###

Using Python, I created a simple data cleaning script to:
- Load data
- Remove duplicates
- Fill or flag missing values
- Standardize date formats
- Output a clean version of the file to a specific location

To help others who may need to use this code, I have commented it out. 

Business Impact:
Dirty data prevents accurate, reliable, and complete reporting if not addressed. Additioanlly, if not handled as far upstream as possible, it would require analysts and other users to fix the issues.  Depending on the skill sets, this may delay the reporting or cause inaccurate reports. Further,  when this taks is performed by one person at the analytical or presentation later, the work is unnecessarily repeated and inefficient.
